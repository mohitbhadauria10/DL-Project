Some students asked about the grading criteria for project. Most of the following was mentioned in the project guideline on Coursera. We will not release the detailed rubric, but here's a short summary again of what we will be looking at.

The Draft will be reviewed by the following dimensions (you could use these as sections)

Abstract
Introduction
Method (clear, reasonable, convincing)
Result (where performance is no more important than analysis. For Draft, you could have incomplete results.)
Conclusion (of progress so far)
Reference (sufficient & correct)
Overall Writing


can follow and reproduce your work after she read your
paper.
– Even if your current results are not good as expected,
there must be analyses about what possible reasons and
solutions/plans are. It is same for when your results are
good also.
– Here the ’results’, especially for the draft, can be
any valuable results. For example, results from simple
model which can be used as one of baseline in your
final paper, results from intermediate steps prior to your
ultimate target task, results with a tiny subset of your
dataset generated for a verification of your pipeline,
etc., all those followed by your own analysis can be
used.
– Grading of both your draft and final paper is not based
on some ’numbers’ from metrics. Instead, it will be
on how comprehensive your project/paper is; how well
the problem and the task are defined; whether your
approach including feature extraction/processing and
modeling are reasonable and convincing; how well you
described these things, etc.
– Show us the continued optimization plan you will try
