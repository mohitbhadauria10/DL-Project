Some students asked about the grading criteria for project. Most of the following was mentioned in the project guideline on Coursera. We will not release the detailed rubric, but here's a short summary again of what we will be looking at.

The Draft will be reviewed by the following dimensions (you could use these as sections)

Abstract
Introduction
Method (clear, reasonable, convincing)
Result (where performance is no more important than analysis. For Draft, you could have incomplete results.)
Conclusion (of progress so far)
Reference (sufficient & correct)
Overall Writing
